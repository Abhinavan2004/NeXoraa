✅ 2. MongoDB Atlas
Purpose: Cloud-based NoSQL database service

🔹 What it does:
Stores your app’s user data, messages, login credentials, chat history, etc.
It’s scalable (you can increase capacity as your user base grows).
Provides high availability, security, and backups.

🔹 Why it's useful:
No need to manually set up database servers.
Easy integration with backend (Node.js, Express, etc.).
Offers a free tier with sufficient resources for dev/testing.
Built-in support for connection to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure.

🔹 Features:
Clusters (database instance you connect to).
Collections (like tables, where documents are stored).
Documents (JSON-like records).
Easy access via MongoDB URI (used in .env file).

3.) in mongoose schema we have to types of schema formation 
        --> 1.const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({...here our schema definition});
        --> 2.const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({..here our schema defination} , {timestamps: true})

    diff is that in 2nd format the data entry in the databse will be done with timestamps like the data 
    entry is done at 12:53:37 like this or something like this which helps in telling the data entry is with us from how much time.

========================================================================================================================

4.)  friends:[
    {
    type:mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref:"User"
 }
]

this is what i have used in databse Schema so what is its used???? --->> it is used for storing the relations in form of 
array of objectIds in the database. It helps in having the relation between the two tables in the database.

5.) To create a random profile_Pic_avatar as if the user has uploaded his image or dos not want to upload then you can 
generate the avatar png from the website """AVATAR PLACEHOLDER"""..

it helps in generating the avatar png;-'s using its API..

6.) We have used Stream Upserts in our code. What is it?
--> Upsert = Update + Insert
It means:
If a record (user, message, etc.) already exists, then update it.
If it doesn't exist, then create (insert) it.

Stream Upserts: Creating or updating user profiles on Stream's backend.
Ensures the user is always in sync between your system and Stream Chat.
It avoids duplicate users and ensures a consistent user profile.
Upstreamer() is probably a helper/wrapper function in your code.

7.) In the frontend we have used Tailwind CSS and as a component Library we are using DAISY UI.

    DaisyUI is a Tailwind CSS component library that adds pre-built, styled UI components (like buttons, modals, alerts, dropdowns, etc.) using Tailwind utility classes. It's built on top of Tailwind CSS, making it easier and faster to build beautiful UIs without writing tons of custom styles.

    🧠 What is DaisyUI?
It's a plugin for Tailwind CSS.
It provides a collection of customizable, accessible, and responsive components.
All components are built with Tailwind classes, so they work seamlessly with your Tailwind config.
It supports dark mode, themes, and is highly customizable.

    🛠️ Why use DaisyUI?
Benefit	Description
🔧 Ready-made components	No need to build common UI elements from scratch (e.g., buttons, cards).
🎨 Theme support	Easily switch between multiple pre-defined themes (light, dark, etc.).
🕶 Dark mode built-in	Simple to enable dark mode for your app.
⚙ Works with Tailwind	Uses Tailwind classes, so no extra learning curve if you're using Tailwind.
🧩 Extendable and Custom	You can customize or extend its components easily.
