Stores your app’s user data, messages, login credentials, chat history, etc.
It’s scalable (you can increase capacity as your user base grows).
Provides high availability, security, and backups.

🔹 Why it's useful:
No need to manually set up database servers.
Easy integration with backend (Node.js, Express, etc.).
Offers a free tier with sufficient resources for dev/testing.
Built-in support for connection to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure.

🔹 Features:
Clusters (database instance you connect to).
Collections (like tables, where documents are stored).
Documents (JSON-like records).
Easy access via MongoDB URI (used in .env file).

3.) in mongoose schema we have to types of schema formation 
        --> 1.const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({...here our schema definition});
        --> 2.const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({..here our schema defination} , {timestamps: true})

    diff is that in 2nd format the data entry in the databse will be done with timestamps like the data 
    entry is done at 12:53:37 like this or something like this which helps in telling the data entry is with us from how much time.

========================================================================================================================

4.)  friends:[
    {
    type:mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref:"User"
 }
]

this is what i have used in databse Schema so what is its used???? --->> it is used for storing the relations in form of 
array of objectIds in the database. It helps in having the relation between the two tables in the database.

6.) We have used Stream Upserts in our code. What is it?
--> Upsert = Update + Insert
It means:
If a record (user, message, etc.) already exists, then update it.
If it doesn't exist, then create (insert) it.

Stream Upserts: Creating or updating user profiles on Stream's backend.
Ensures the user is always in sync between your system and Stream Chat.
It avoids duplicate users and ensures a consistent user profile.
Upstreamer() is probably a helper/wrapper function in your code.

7.) In the frontend we have used Tailwind CSS and as a component Library we are using DAISY UI.

    DaisyUI is a Tailwind CSS component library that adds pre-built, styled UI components (like buttons, modals, alerts, dropdowns, etc.) using Tailwind utility classes. It's built on top of Tailwind CSS, making it easier and faster to build beautiful UIs without writing tons of custom styles.

It provides a collection of customizable, accessible, and responsive components.
All components are built with Tailwind classes, so they work seamlessly with your Tailwind config.
